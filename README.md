# Studio Safar Website
This is a website design for my Web Design and Development _(IAT 339)_ class in my university _(Simon Fraser University)_. This is considered to be my very first web project where I got to learn about HTML, CSS, and a little bit of Javascript. The task for this project was to pick a brand or a personality and design a website according to their brand and identity. 
So I chose a Lebanese stduio, [Studio Safar](https://www.instagram.com/studiosafar/?hl=en) and made [this website](https://cheerful-trifle-cdbe6b.netlify.app/) for them!
- The website has its design flaws including but not limited to:
  - Layout issues
  - Accessibility issues
  - Data saving issues
---
Since this project, I have learned so much more about web development and having this as my starting point was really great!
